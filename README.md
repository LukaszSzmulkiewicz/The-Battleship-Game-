# The-Battleship-Game

The-Battleship-Game
The game is for two players, each player allocates 10 ships of 4 sizes on the 10x10 board. The data is stored in 1D 300 size array, which is used for the board. 
Index 0 is used for the field name A1, A2..., the index 1 is used to record the player ships location and the last index 2 is used to record the player shots. 
The user is able to place the ships vertically and horizontally. The program also validates the user choice to make sure the ship fits in the 10x10 board range. 
The program lets the user know if the ship destroyed or not.
